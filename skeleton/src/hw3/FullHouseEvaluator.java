/**
 * Evaluator for a generalized full house.  The number of required
 * cards is equal to the hand size.  If the hand size is an odd number
 * n, then there must be (n / 2) + 1 cards of the matching rank and the
 * remaining (n / 2) cards must be of matching rank. In this case, when constructing
 * a hand, the larger group must be listed first even if of lower rank
 * than the smaller group</strong> (e.g. as [3 3 3 5 5] rather than [5 5 3 3 3]).
 * If the hand size is even, then half the cards must be of matching 
 * rank and the remaining half of matching rank.  Any group of cards,
 * all of which are the same rank, always satisfies this
 * evaluator.
 * 
 * The name of this evaluator is "Full House".
